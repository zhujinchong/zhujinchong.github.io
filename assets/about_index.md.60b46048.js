Subsequently, I was admitted to the graduate school of Dalian University of Technology and conducted in-depth research on deep learning algorithms in the Red Ant Laboratory. After completing my studies, I joined Nanjing Sinovatio Technology Co., Ltd. and have been working there ever since. In the first year of working at the company, I served as a Java full-stack development engineer, mainly responsible for writing and maintaining the core code of the project. Later, I transferred to the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and began to explore large-scale language technology and its application in the real world. Now, my main work is to study how to translate large-scale language technology into practical applications and promote its development in various fields. </div></div><div class="title">Education</div><div class="hr"></div><div class="content"> 2018-2021: Data Imputation Based on Deep Learning <br> * ISNN 2020 《Imputation of Incomplete Data Based on Attribute Cross Fitting Model and Iterative Missing Value Variables》 <br> * Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing 2021 《Attribute-Associated Neuron Modeling and Missing Value Imputation for Incomplete Data》 <br> * ICCCBDA 2021 《Type Identification and Feature Selection of Chinese Poor Families Based on Density and Feature Aggregation Distribution》 </div><div class="title">Skills</div><div class="hr"></div><div class="content"> frontend: html, css, javascript, vue <br> backend: java, springboot, redis, postgresql, kafka, elasticsearch, janusgraph <br> algorithms: python, machine learning, deep learning, nlp </div></div>',1),v=[c],g={__name:"about",setup(t){return(i,n)=>(e(),a("div",l,v))}},m=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"layout":"home","navbar":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"about/index.md","filePath":"about/index.md","lastUpdated":1708824706000}'),u={name:"about/index.md"},p=Object.assign(u,{setup(t){return(i,n)=>(e(),a("div",null,[s(g)]))}});export{m as __pageData,p as default};
